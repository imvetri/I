Learn something new

Good climate, get outside

Create a magic ball in the computer

I steal from science and religion and give it to god.

Runaway in silence.

Think of something cruel and Speak your mind out,

Wish me good luck, I’ll. be around.

Searching for something that will never be found.

Repetition is a therapy, use it for good.

Close close close close.

Stomach doesn’t feel so good.

Smoke smoke smoke smoke.

Oh man, leave me alone, I don’t wanna live this world anymore.

Mother plant needs a reborn.

Write everyday,

Fight me anyway.

blood is sharper`
